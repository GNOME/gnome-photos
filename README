Photos, like Documents, Music and Videos, is one of the core GNOME
applications meant for find and reminding the user about her content.
The internal architecture Photos is based on Documents -- the document
manager application for GNOME, because they share similar UI/UX
patterns and objectives.

Points to remember while hacking on Photos:

+ Avoid unnecessary divergences from Documents. Valid exceptions
  include changes needed to convert JavaScript idioms to their C
  equivalents.

+ Share the same set of widgets as Documents, or the other core GNOME
  applications, as much as possible.

+ Monitor changes in the Documents code base and clone them when
  relevant.

+ Follow the GNU coding style. To accomodate longer class and method
  names due to namespace prefixes, line lengths upto 120 characters
  are allowed.
